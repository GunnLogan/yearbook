### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your Company.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask David. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment, you should be comfortable using HTML tags to create layout (with divs, sections, etc). You should also be comfortable with using content tags to insert text and images. Finally, you should understand the effect of margins and padding in CSS.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

Done with the main task? Here's some ideas for things to continue with:

1. Align the cards to the center of the page.
2. Use box shadows to make the cards look like Polaroid pictures.
3. Add more personality to your yearbook, look up CSS animations and add the ones you like.
4. Originally, all images came in different sizes and ratios. As a developer that's a pretty common situation, for instance when you fetch images from an API or CMS you don't necessarily know what the ratio will be - you just have to make it work! How would you have solved this assignment if this was the case? Here you can find the [original photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z0aMILJmfcypRTD8oJCWrM3MrPILQvRP?usp=sharing) try and solve the assigment again but with these photos instead.
